## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Forms
- [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)- Fonts



### What I learned

When writing a solution for this task, we learned a lot about how to make the correct layout of a site that looks like a fill-in form
We also learned how to use icons for the title of the page.
```html
<head>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
</head>
```
We learned how to import fonts into our site
```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap");
```
We met with a attribute such as "font-family"
This font family determines which font the browser will use to display text on a web page.
```css
    font-family: "Poppins",sans-serif;
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

In the course of solving this problem, we determined for ourselves that we still have a lot to learn about JavaScript.
And also about some subtleties in CSS

### Useful resources

- [CSS Box Shadow Generator](https://active-vision.ru/icon/box-shadow/) - This site helped us create the necessary shadows for the block elements.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) - This resource was listed in style-guide.md. He helped us change the font of the site.
